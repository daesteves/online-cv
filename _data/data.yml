    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I began my career at NOS SGPS, a major ISP in Portugal, as an outsorced network consultant.
      
      I started  by integrating the GPR (Gestão e Produção de Rede) team as an operational reinforcement, where I installed networking terminal equipment and made core services configurations.
      
      A few months later I was offered a move to the Delivery team (Entrega), where I joined the NOS Corporate Control Tower (Torre de Controlo Empresarial) as an implementation technician specialized in the delivering the service to clients.
      For about 1 year I worked as a technical team member, making CPE configurations, validating circuits and as 1st and 2nd line.
      
      Later came the opportunity to lead the TC team as technical and operational manager, a function that I have maintained to date.
