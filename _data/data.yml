career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     A highly motivated and eager to learn Azure Support Engineer, currently working as a vendor at Microsoft in Lisbon, Portugal.

     I've worked on the networking field for 5 years now, first in Telecommunication Operators and Managed Services Providers and more recently in Azure Support, as a Support Engineer for Azure Networking.
     Over the years, I have gained valuable experience while working with corporate customers on a technical level and by managing resources in response to various project demands.
     I have technical and communication skills due to various projects in wich I participated, as well as a team leader for my team.

     I began my networking career at NOS SGPS, a major ISP in Portugal, as an outsorced network consultant.

     I started by integrating the GPR (Gestão e Produção de Rede) team as an operational reinforcement.
     A few months later I was offered a move to the Delivery team (Entrega), where I joined the NOS Corporate Delivery and Implementation Team (Torre de Controlo Empresarial) and where I ended up as a Technical Manager/Advisor.

     In September 2019 I joined GFI Portugal and started working for Microsoft, on the Azure Networking Support team in Lisbon.
